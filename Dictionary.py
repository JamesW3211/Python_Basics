Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world

"""A key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other. When you
provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key
is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by commas.

"""Adding New Key-Value Pairs
Dictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs
to a dictionary at any time. For example, to add a new key-value pair, you
would give the name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square
brackets along with the new value."""

"""Starting with an Empty Dictionary
Itâ€™s sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty dictionary and then add each new item to it. 
To start filling an empty dictionary, define a dictionary with an empty set of braces and then add each key-value
pair on its own line."""
